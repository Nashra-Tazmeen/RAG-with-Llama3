# RAG-with-Llama3 
Here,We will set up a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Llama 3, LangChain, ChromaDB, and Gradio.

Why RAG with Llama 3?
RAG enhances language models by combining them with a retrieval mechanism, improving accuracy and contextual relevance. Llama 3 is an excellent choice for this due to its advanced language capabilities.

Tools used for
Llama 3: Our language model.

LangChain: Framework for LLM applications.

ChromaDB: Database for storing and querying embedded text data.

Gradio: Interface for interacting with the model.

Google Colab: for efficient computing.
